# Celeritas-auto-build <br> EnderChannel fork for build all package jars

_fork from kappa-maintainer/Celeritas-auto-build_

Auto builds of [https://git.taumc.org/embeddedt/celeritas](https://git.taumc.org/embeddedt/celeritas)

Not based on tag so highly risky, use at your own risk

Do not use the `-dev-dev.jar` and `-dev-remapped-thin.jar `!

_~All right, you may not be able to download those jars in the release~_
